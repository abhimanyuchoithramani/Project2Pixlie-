Here is my 2nd Test Project for Junior Python Developer.

Crawl and Display

The Django part is contained in the DjangoPart folder.
And the Scrapy part in the ScrapyPart folder
For DataBase I have used MySQL
with the database name as "project2"

Please have a look over my codes, and if you find any error in the codes,
please be kind to let me know, so that I can try to solve it.

Hoping You like my codings.

:)
